    <p>Select the window you want to snap and press the Windows Logo Key + Left Arrow or the Windows Logo Key + Right
        Arrow to snap the window to the side of the screen where you want it to be. You can also move it to a corner
        after
        snapping it.</p>

    <h3><span>Window</span>&diams;</h3>
    <div>
        <p>With the window selected, press the Windows Logo Key + Up Arrow or the Windows Logo Key + Down Arrow
            to get it into the desired corner. The window is then in its smallest possible state, which is a quarter of
            the screen.Then you can use the Windows Logo Key + Arrow Keys to move it wherever you want.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Snap with Snap Assist</h2>

    <p>Snap Assist appears after youâ€™ve snapped a window but have a lot of available space on your screen. Any other
        open
        windows are displayed in that space as thumbnails.</p>

    <p>To use Snap Assist, click the thumbnail of the window you want to open in the empty space on your screen. If
        you have two windows displayed side-by-side, you can resize both windows simultaneously by selecting and
        dragging
        the dividing line. Resize the window on one side to the size you want it to be, and then release the mouse
        button.
        The other window will resize itself to fit alongside the first one, so you won't have any empty screen space.
